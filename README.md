# django-dash-plotly

The purpose of django-plotly-dash is to enable Plotly Dash applications to be served up as part of a Django application, in order to provide these features:

1. Multiple dash applications can be used on a single page
2. Separate instances of a dash application can persist along with internal state
3. Leverage user management and access control and other parts of the Django infrastructure
4. Consolidate into a single server process to simplify scaling
